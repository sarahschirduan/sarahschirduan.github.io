### GitHub

If you are setting up a website from scratch, this post is for you.

I wanted to learn the basics of setting up a website and HTML before choosing a crisp pre-built template.

You can set up a website for free through GitHub. Follow the step by step tutorial by clicking this link. <a href="https://pages.github.com/"> https://pages.github.com </a>

This is what I did when following their tutorial
* Step 1: When I created my repository I named it <i>sarahschirduan</i>
* Step 2: I suggest using GitHub Desktop to clone your directory <a href="https://desktop.github.com/"> https://desktop.github.com/</a>
* Step 3: The text editor I used was Atom <br>
  <a href="https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/"> https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/</a>
* Step 4: Commit & publish and go to your website: <u>https://username.github.io</u><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tip: If you want to do more than one commit at a time, be sure to type something in the Summary box.

Next, I created an about page & blog page. To do that go to your github.io page and click Create new file, I named one about.html and another blog.html.

After creating those links, I updated my main index file in Atom so I could access those other links from the home page.

This is what my code looked like.

<a href="/assets/img/Main.png"><img src="/assets/img/Main.png"></a>

Ta da!

As magnificent as my initial landing page looked, I was ready for something slightly more professional.

You can download free website templates from this site <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/"> http://jekyllthemes.org/</a>

First, you’ll need to download Jekyll <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/"> https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/</a> Scroll to the bottom and choose your operating system, Windows, Mac, or Linux.

If you have a Windows operating system, you may need to install a new terminal to get Jekyll working <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server/"> https://ubuntu.com/download/server/</a>

I chose the Moon theme. <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/moon/"> http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/moon/</a>

Once you download the new theme, add them to your GitHub folder on your local file. Before committing them in GitHub Desktop, edit your existing index & about files. I changed the names to <i>indexy</i> & <i>origabout</i> so the new Moon theme index and about HTML files would load on the website properly.

This is what my GitHub folder looked like after downloading Moon theme & changing the initial names for index & about file.

The beauty of using a prebuilt template, is it’s easy to personalize it for your purposes (changing background image, posts, etc). Simply open the HTML files in Atom, make adjustments, then commit them in GitHub Desktop.

Now my site looks marvelous.

Good luck with your site & future projects! You got this!

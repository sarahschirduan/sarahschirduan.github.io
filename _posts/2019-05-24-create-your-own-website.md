### GitHub

I wanted to learn the basics of setting up a website and HTML before choosing a crisp pre-built template.

You can set up a website for free through GitHub. Follow the step by step tutorial by clicking this link. <a href="https://pages.github.com/"> https://pages.github.com </a>

This is what I did when following their tutorial
* Step 1: When I created my repository I named it <i>sarahschirduan</i>
* Step 2: I suggest using GitHub Desktop to clone your directory <a href="https://desktop.github.com/"> https://desktop.github.com/</a>
* Step 3: The text editor I used was Atom <a href="https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/"> https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/</a>
* Step 4: Commit & publish and go to your website: <u>https://username.github.io</u>
<p>     Tip: If you want to do more than one commit at a time, be sure to type something in the Summary box. </p>

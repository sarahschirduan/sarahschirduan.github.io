## Project Overview

If you are starting out in data science or analytics or R, then this post is for you.

I enrolled in a class teaching R through St. Joseph’s University. But it has been about a year since I finished the course, so I wanted a refresher about tackling a dataset from start to finish. I checked out interesting projects on Kaggle and came across this data set
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data" target="_ blank"> https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data </a>.

The purpose is to create a model that accurately predicts who on the Titanic would survive the sinking of the ship. As someone who is not
yet an expert, the clarity of this challenge appealed to me. I also found a great tutorial for this data set on YouTube. For the most part,
I followed Langer’s code and steps for analyzing this dataset. He does an excellent job of explaining R & statistical techniques as he goes through it.

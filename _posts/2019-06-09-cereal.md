### Project Overview

My goal for this blog is to take data and find intriguing insights. I’ve been scouring Kaggle for simple datasets that have relatable variables. One such dataset has 77 observations (ie rows) and 21 variables (columns) involving cereals and nutritional facts.

Kaggle is a great resource if you are starting out in the data science field. Click on this link for a full explanation of the variables.

#### Objectives

1. Are some cereal manufacturers healthier than others?
2. Do grocery stores place the unhealthiest cereals at eye level, making it harder for the consumer to choose healthier options.
3. What impacts the rating the cereal receives? <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, Kaggle doesn’t tell us if it’s a consumer rating or a cereal industry rating

### Exploring the Data

Does the data type make sense for each variable?

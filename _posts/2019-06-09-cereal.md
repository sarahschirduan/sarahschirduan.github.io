### Project Overview

My goal for this blog is to take data and find intriguing insights. I’ve been scouring Kaggle for simple datasets that have relatable variables. One such dataset has 77 observations (ie rows) and 21 variables (columns) involving cereals and nutritional facts.

Kaggle is a great resource if you are starting out in the data science field. Click on this link for a full explanation of the variables.

#### Objectives

1. Are some cereal manufacturers healthier than others?
2. Do grocery stores place the unhealthiest cereals at eye level, making it harder for the consumer to choose healthier options.
3. What impacts the rating the cereal receives? <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, Kaggle doesn’t tell us if it’s a consumer rating or a cereal industry rating

### Exploring the Data

Does the data type make sense for each variable?

* Factor variables
    * Name, Manufacturer, Type: &nbsp;&nbsp; Leave alone
* Integer variables
    * Calories, Sodium, Sugars, Potassium: &nbsp;&nbsp; Leave alone
    * Protein, Fat, Vitamins: &nbsp;&nbsp; Change to factor?
        * For these factors, at a glance I see that there are not many unique values. Let’s take a closer look by using length (unique) code. For example, length (unique) for protein has 6 unique values, it may be worthwhile to change this to a factor. What we’ll do is create a new variable that takes the protein variable and converts it to a factor not an integer. The reason we’re doing this is because a lot of models work better with factor variables as opposed to integer/numeric variables. We’ll do the same with the fat & vitamins variables.

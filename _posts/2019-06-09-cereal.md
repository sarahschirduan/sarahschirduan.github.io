## Project Overview

My goal for this blog is to take data and find intriguing insights. I’ve been scouring Kaggle for simple datasets that have relatable variables. One such dataset has 77 observations (ie rows) and 21 variables (columns) involving cereals and nutritional facts.

Kaggle is a great resource if you are starting out in the data science field. Click on this link for a full explanation of the variables.

## Objectives

1. Are some cereal manufacturers healthier than others?
2. Do grocery stores place the unhealthiest cereals at eye level, making it harder for the consumer to choose healthier options?
3. What impacts the rating the cereal receives? <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, Kaggle doesn’t tell us if it’s a consumer rating or a cereal industry rating
<br>

## Exploring the Data

### Does the data type make sense for each variable?

</figure>

* Factor variables
    * Name, Manufacturer, Type: &nbsp;&nbsp; Leave alone
* Integer variables
    * Calories, Sodium, Sugars, Potassium: &nbsp; Leave alone
    * Protein, Fat, Vitamins: &nbsp;&nbsp; Change to factor?
        * For these factors, at a glance I see that there are not many unique values. Let’s take a closer look by using length (unique) code. For example, length (unique) for protein has 6 unique values, it may be worthwhile to change this to a factor. What we’ll do is create a new variable that takes the protein variable and converts it to a factor not an integer. The reason we’re doing this is because a lot of models work better with factor variables as opposed to integer/numeric variables. We’ll do the same with the fat & vitamins variables.

        <figure>

        </figure>

    * Shelf: Change
        * This one is different, the number ‘1’ does not help us for it’s numeric value, but is only beneficial because we know ‘1’ means it’s on the very bottom shelf. Thus, for this one we’ll want to convert it from integer to factor.

* Numeric variables
    * Fiber, Carbohydrates, Rating: &nbsp; Leave alone
    * Weight, Cups: &nbsp;&nbsp; Change to factor?
        * After using the same length (unique) code on the weight variable we find there are 7 unique values, so it may be worthwhile to convert to factor variable. For cups, there were 12 unique values within the data set. This could go either way, we’ll create a new factor variable type and test the original and the factor variables.


We need to check for missing values. I used the code below to scan the dataset. All values came back false so we are good to move forward. Note: A perfect dataset is rare in the real world.

### Are some cereal manufacturers healthier than others?

We will specifically look at the relationship between manufacturer and sugar/fat levels. Is one manufacturer producing mostly sugary/fatty cereals?

I used the ggplot2 package for the graph. Follow <a href="https://github.com/sarahschirduan/sarahschirduan.github.io/projects" target="_ blank"> this link </a> if you want to see the code.

</figure>

We can see that General Mills, Kelloggs, & Post have comparatively higher sugar levels.

Nabisco has lower fat levels, although the other brands seem to be about the same.

Let’s look at average fat & sugars levels in a table format across manufacturers to see if it confirms the conclusions we drew from the visual display. This reveals that Quaker has the highest average fat levels (which wasn’t quite decipherable in the chart).

### Do grocery stores place the unhealthiest cereals at eye level, making it harder for the consumer to choose healthier options?

We will look at the relationship between shelf level and potassium, fiber, vitamins, and protein. We are making the assumption that Shelf 2 is at eye level.

Let’s see if the variable % of daily vitamin affects what shelf the cereal is placed on. For the 1st and 2nd shelf, they have similar %’s, 0 & 25% of daily value. However, we can see the total cereal count is highest on the 3rd shelf. This shelf also has the best vitamin levels.

<br>

<figure>
<a href="/assets/img/cereal6.png"><img src="/assets/img/cereal6.png"></a>
</figure>

This graph is not as simple to read because there are more levels for the protein factor variable versus the vitamin variable. We can see the 1st shelf has lower protein (mostly 1’s, 2’s, and 3’s). The 2nd shelf has even worse protein levels – remember this is the shelf we presume to be at eye level. The 3rd shelf has the best protein levels of all.

<figure>
<a href="/assets/img/cereal7.png"><img src="/assets/img/cereal7.png"></a>
</figure>

Next, we’ll take a look at some of our numerical variables. The below graph shows the relationship between fiber, potassium, and shelf the cereal is placed on. We can see that most cereals have potassium between 0 to 150, most fiber ranges from 0 to 5. We notice that the 3rd shelf has the highest potassium levels, the 1st shelf has the smallest line so the types of cereals have consistent fiber & potassium levels. The 2nd shelf dips and rises, meaning there is a wider range of cereals on that shelf in terms of those two nutrition variables.
<br>

</figure>

Overall, though this graph is not the easiest to draw conclusions from. Let’s try a table. This quickly shows us Shelf 2 has the lowest potassium and the lowest fiber. Shelf 3 has the highest potassium levels and the highest fiber amounts. Shelf 1 is in between. In this case a table is more useful than the above graph.

### What impacts the rating the cereal receives?

Now that we have a good feel for the data, let’s look at how the variables impact the rating of the cereal. We’ll run a linear regression model, this shows us a few things:

1. Do the independent variables do a good job of predicting the dependent variables?
2. Which variables have a greater impact on the dependent variable? <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; To put this in perspective, do the nutrition facts (independent variables) explain the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; rating (dependent variable) the cereal received?

## Modeling

Earlier in the analysis we transformed some of the variables from numeric to categorical. We will use the regression model with the exact same variables, but one set will include the variables as originally seen in the dataset, the second set will have the transformed variables.

The blue writing is my code, the white is the output from model.

### Model with Regular Variables
<figure>
<a href="/assets/img/cereal10.png"><img src="/assets/img/cereal10.png"></a>
</figure>

<figure>
<a href="/assets/img/cereal11.png"><img src="/assets/img/cereal11.png"></a>
</figure>

By looking at the Adjusted R – squared, we know the variables explain 90% of the rating. However, we can also see some of the variables did not pass the t test (weight & cups). Before we remove any variables however, let’s re-run the analysis with the transformed categorical variables.

Before we do that, I want to explain something about the transformed variables. When the protein variable was transformed from one numeric variable into 6 factors, we see each of those broken out in the model. This is helpful to us because for example, when protein level is very high (cerealFile$ftrprotein6) it has the Estimate 8.6, whereas when the protein level is lower (protein2 & protein3), the Estimate is 4.13 & 4.56. Thus, a higher protein level has a stronger positive impact on the rating.

The Adjusted R-Square increased from 90% in prior model to 94% in this model, so we know our factor variables are better predictors than leaving them as numeric variables. Additionally, the weight & cup variables in both models did not pass the t-test. The general rule is it should be < 0.05 (you can see the t value in the Pr (>t) column. The other variables pass the test so we will leave them.

### Model with Transformed Variables
<figure>
<a href="/assets/img/cereal12.png"><img src="/assets/img/cereal12.png"></a>
</figure>

We can see each of the variables pass the t test (with the exception of one factor level of protein which we’ll set aside for the moment). The Adjusted R Square is 93%, so even though it decreased versus the last model it is a better model because it excludes the variables that weren’t contributing to rating.

### Model with Transformed Variables, excluding those that did not pass T Test
<figure>
<a href="/assets/img/cereal13.png"><img src="/assets/img/cereal13.png"></a>
</figure>

Let’s add in calories & potassium to see how that impacts it. Both variables pass the t test although they are not particularly low t values. Also, the Estimate of the variable impact is quite low, so we know these variables have a lesser impact on the rating variable. Thus, I’ll keep the calories & potassium variables out.

### Model with 2 New Variables
<figure>
<a href="/assets/img/cereal14.png"><img src="/assets/img/cereal14.png"></a>
</figure>

This final model has an Adjusted R Square of 93% - meaning the variables in the model explain 93% of the rating cereals receive. Also, the overall p value is very small (< 2.2 e-16), so it passed that test. Lastly, we’ll look at the coefficients of the variables.
This is the equation for the model: y = 58.05 + 2.32x<sub>1</sub>(fiber) – 1.44x<sub>2</sub>(sugars) + 4.65x<sub>3</sub>(protein2) + 6.1x<sub>4</sub>(protein3) + 11.75x<sub>5</sub>(protein4) – 5.77x<sub>6</sub>(protein5) + 9.48x<sub>7</sub>(protein6) - 5.15x<sub>8</sub>(fat1) – 9.17x<sub>9</sub>(fat2) - 12.05x<sub>10</sub>(fat3) – 23.28x<sub>11</sub>(fat5) – 11.6x<sub>12</sub>(vitamins25) – 16.41x<sub>13</sub>(vitamins100)

The only variable that does not pass the t test is protein5, so we’ll disregard this line.

* Fiber’s coefficient is 2.3 so this has a slightly positive impact on rating
* Sugar’s coefficient is -1.44 so this has a slightly negative impact on rating
* The protein coefficient gets higher as the grams of protein increases (with the exception of protein5 but that one does not pass the t test so we are not including it). So we know a higher protein level has a larger positive impact on rating
* The fat coefficient gets higher as the grams of fat increases. So we know a higher fat level has a larger negative impact on rating
* The vitamin coefficient gets higher as the % of daily vitamins increase. So, we know a higher vitamin level has a larger negative impact on rating. This one surprised me and I wondered if I made a mistake, so I pulled up the dataset ordered it by highest rating and looked at the vitamin level. Sure enough, there are a lot of ‘0’s for the vitamin level near the top of the list.

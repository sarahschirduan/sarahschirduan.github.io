### Scenario
It is vital for Simply Southern (fictional name & data) to choose a dashboard visualization software.
Presenting metrics and sales data such that our managers and executives can more easily find opportunities is a
significant benefit of a dashboard tool. Our top choices are Tableau and Qlik. Each has advantages and disadvantages.

### Loading Data
The first step is loading data into the program. Tableau is more user friendly with loading an Excel or JSON file,
or from a system such as Tableau Server, SQL, or Oracle. Each tool has an optional data cleanup step. However, Qlik goes a step beyond with making associations, linking tables with common dimensions and measures. Both easily allow the next step which is editing the sheet and adding charts.

### Display

Tableau has a more aesthetically appealing layout than Qlik. Dimensions and measures are on the left and chart types are on the right.
In Qlik, everything is on one side, so there are more clicks when building a chart. See Figure 1 below.

 Dimensions and measures are not separated out in Qlik, thus with nearly every chart the user has to not only choose a field, but then decide if it will be a dimension or measure. Additionally, alternating between charts types in Tableau is extraordinarily easy. In Qlik, if the user decides to change the chart type, it can mean rebuilding from scratch. Tableau allows for quick comparison with the various ways to display the data. Tableau is similarly superior with the number of chart types available such as bullet charts and trend lines compared to Qlik. However, Tableau has some limitations when building charts. For example, area charts and line chart cannot be selected without a date dimension. Furthermore, when I add additional measures, it will duplicate the chart instead of simply allowing a second column to be added. It is less straightforward than Qlik. A benefit of Qlik is that it allows for measures to be added to the userâ€™s specifications. The downside is that it requires an excessive number of clicks to create a visual.
